## üß™ Development Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Execute `npm install`
3. Create a new app / client id at [developer.spotify.com](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).
4. Copy your client id into `/src/config.ts`.
5. Click "Edit Settings" in the newly created Spotify developer app and add a redirect URI to where `/spotify-authorization` will be hosted - by default this will be `https://localhost:3000/spotify-authorization`
6. Set `HTTPS=true` (HTTPS is required to use `window.crypto`)
   - In PowerShell: `$env:HTTPS = "true"`
7. Set `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` (react-scripts doesn't play nice with newer versions of Node)
   - In PowerShell: ` $env:NODE_OPTIONS = "--openssl-legacy-provider"`
8. Execute `npm start`
9. Accept the SSL warning

## ‚ùì Why?

Emotionify is an application I had thought about for a few years after doing a project at university on attempting to detect emotion in music and portraying it in an interactive environment.

I was curious how the method implemented would play out with music I listen to every day and wanted some extra tools for Spotify playlists.

Emotionify is not 100% accurate as emotion is highly opinion based and the values used to sort songs are averages over the whole song. This tool however does give insight on how well a computer can plot an emotional gradient with a list of songs.
